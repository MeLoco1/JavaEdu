already
knocked
50,
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
I
was
four
years
oldE.
Friends,
women
I
have
never
done.
I
looked
at
the
women
every
time
he
passed
by
on
the
streets
or
in
other
places,
but
without
the
desire
to
look
and
with
a
sense
of
futility.
I
masturbate
regularly,
but
the
thought
of
having
a
relationship
with
a
woman
-
even
on
non-sexual
basis
-
was
beyond
my
imagination.
I
had
a
daughter
6
years
old,
illegitimate.
She
lived
with
her
mother,
and
I
was
paying
child
support.
I
was
married
many
years
ago,
when
I
was
35.
That
marriage
lasted
two
and
a
half
years.
My
wife
tyrewewew
divorced
me.
I
was
in
love
once.
She
died
of
acute
alcoholism.
She
died
at
48
and
I
was
38.
His
wife
was
12
years
younger
than
me.
I
guess
now
she
was
dead,
too,
though
not
sure.
6
years
after
the
divorce,
she
wrote
me
a
long
letter
to
every
Christmas.
I
never
said
...
I'm
not
sure
when
I
first
saw
Lydia
Vance.
6
years
ago,
I
think
I
just
threw
the
service
at
the
post
office,
where
spent
twelve
years
and
was
trying
to
become
a
writer.
I
was
in
terror
and
were
drinking
more
than
usual.
I
tried
to
write
the
first
novel.
Every
night,
after
work,
I
drank
a
pint
of
whiskey
and
two
half-dozen
beers.
Smoked
a
cheap
cigar,
printed,
drank
and
listened
to
classical
music
on
the
radio
until
dawn.
I
set
out
to
ten
pages
a
night,
but
never
found
out
the
next
day,
how
much
is
actually
written.
Usually
in
the
morning
I
went
up,
threw
up,
then
went
into
the
front
room
and
looked
at
the
couch
-
how
many
pages.
His
ten
I
always
exceeded.
Sometimes
there
lay
17,
18,
23,
25
pages.
Of
course,
the
work
of
each
night
had
to
be
either
cleaned
or
disposed
of.
On
the
first
novel
I've
gone
twenty
one
night.
Owners
of
the
yard,
where
I
lived,
who
lived
on
the
margins
of
themselves,
thought
I
was
crazy.
Every
morning
when
I
woke
up
on
my
porch
was
a
large
brown
paper
bag.
The
contents
vary,
but
usually
lie
inside
tomatoes,
radishes,
oranges,
green
onions,
cans
of
soup,
red
onion.
Every
now
and
then
at
night
I
drank
beer
with
the
hosts,
4-5
hours
in
the
morning.
The
old
man
chops
off,
and
the
old
woman
and
I
usually
kept
in
hand,
and
sometimes
I
kissed
her.
At
the
door,
always
print
in
addition
to
it
for
real.
She
was
badly
wrinkled,
but
what
can
you
do.
She
was
Catholic
and
looked
very
nice
when
worn
pink
hat
and
set
off
on
Sunday
morning
in
church.
I
think
I
met
Lydia
Vance
on
his
first
poetry
reading.
It
was
held
at
the
bookstore
on
Kenmore
Avenue
-
in
the
"bascule
bridge."
Again,
I
was
terrified.
Arrogant,
but
terrified.
When
I
walked
in,
there
were
only
standing
room.
Before
Peter,
filled
to
the
same
bench
and
lived
with
a
black
girl,
was
a
pile
of
cash.
-
That's
the
same
shit
-
he
said
to
me
-
if
I
could
always
cram
them
here
so
I'd
still
have
enough
time
to
India.
I
walked
in
and
they
applauded.
If
we
talk
about
the
poetry
reading,
I
had
to
tear
myself
hymen.
I
read
30
minutes,
then
ask
for
a
break.
I
have
been
sober
and
felt
at
me
out
of
the
dark
staring
eyes.
Came
to
talk
to
a
few
people.
Then,
during
a
lull,
came
Lydia
Vance.
I
sat
at
a
table
drinking
beer.
She
laid
both
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table,
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
me.
She
had
long
brown
hair
is
a
decent
length,
a
prominent
nose
and
one
eye
is
not
quite
combined
with
the
other.
But
it
comes
from
the
life
force
-
it
could
not
be
ignored.
I
could
feel
the
vibration
ran
between
us.
Some
-
perverts
and
bad,
but
still
they
were.
She
looked
at
me,
I
looked
back
at
her.
Lydia
Vance
was
suede
cowboy
jacket
with
fringe
on
the
collar.
Her
breasts
were
nothing.
I
said
to
her:
-
I
would
like
to
tear
off
your
jacket
with
fringe
-
with
this
we
could
start.
Lydia
moved.
It
did
not
work.
I
never
know
what
to
say
to
the
ladies.
And
feed
her
well.
I
watched
this
beautiful
stern
when
Lydia
departed.
Back
jeans
hugged
her
and
I
watched
her
as
she
sails
away.
I
finished
the
second
half
of
the
readings
and
forgot
about
Lydia
as
forget
about
all
the
women
who
were
overtaken
on
the
sidewalks.
Took
my
money,
signed
a
few
napkins,
a
few
scraps
of
paper,
then
went
back
home.
I
am
still
working
every
night
on
the
first
novel.
Until
6.18
pm
to
write
I
never
sat
down.
It
was
then
that
I
observed
at
the
entrance
of
his
wing
of
the
terminal
at
the
post
office.
And
they
showed
up
at
6:
Peter
and
Lydia
Vance.
I
opened
the
door.
Peter
said:
-
Look,
Henry,
look
what
I
brought
you!
Lydia
jumped
up
on
the
coffee
table.
Jeans
sitting
on
it,
instead.
She
shook
her
long
brown
hair
from
side
to
side.
It
was
insane,
it
was
marvelous.
I
first
considered
the
possibility
of
having
to
actually
make
love
to
her.
She
began
to
read
poetry.
Own.
It
was
very
bad.
Peter
tried
to
stop
it:
-
No!
No!
No
talk
of
the
house,
Henry
Chinaski!
-
Let
him
read,
Peter!
I
wanted
to
look
at
her
buttocks.
She
paced
up
and
down
the
old
one
the
coffee
table.
Then
began
to
dance.
She
waved
her
arms.
Poetry
was
terrible,
and
the
madness
of
the
body
-
not
at
all.
Lydia
jumped.
-
How
do
you
like
it,
Henry?
-
What?
-

me
out
of
the
dark
staring
eyes.
Came
to
talk
to
a
few
people.
Then,
during
a
lull,
came
Lydia
Vance.
I
sat
at
a
table
drinking
beer.
She
laid
both
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table,
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
me.
She
had
long
brown
hair
is
a
decent
length,
a
prominent
nose
and
one
eye
is
not
quite
combined
with
the
other.
But
it
comes
from
the
life
force
-
it
could
not
be
ignored.
I
could
feel
the
vibration
ran
between
us.
Some
-
perverts
and
bad,
but
still
they
were.
She
looked
at
me,
I
looked
back
at
her.
Lydia
Vance
was
suede
cowboy
jacket
with
fringe
on
the
collar.
Her
breasts
were
nothing.
I
said
to
her:
-
I
would
like
to
tear
off
your
jacket
with
fringe
-
with
this
we
could
start.
Lydia
moved.
It
did
not
work.
I
never
know
what
to
say
to
the
ladies.
And
feed
her
well.
I
watched
this
beautiful
stern
when
Lydia
departed.
Back
jeans
hugged
her
and
I
watched
her
as
she
sails
away.
I
finished
the
second
half
of
the
readings
and
forgot
about
Lydia
as
forget
about
all
the
women
who
were
overtaken
on
the
sidewalks.
Took
my
money,
signed
a
few
napkins,
a
few
scraps
of
paper,
then
went
back
home.
I
am
still
working
every
night
on
the
first
novel.
Until
6.18
pm
to
write
I
never
sat
down.
It
was
then
that
I
observed
at
the
entrance
of
his
wing
of
the
terminal
at
the
post
office.
And
they
showed
up
at
6:
Peter
and
Lydia
Vance.
I
opened
the
door.
Peter
said:
-
Look,
Henry,
look
what
I
brought
you!
Lydia
jumped
up
on
the
coffee
table.
Jeans
sitting
on
it,
instead.
She
shook
her
long
brown
hair
from
side
to
side.
It
was
insane,
it
was
marvelous.
I
first
considered
the
possibility
of
having
to
actually
make
love
to
her.
She
began
to
read
poetry.
Own.
It
was
very
bad.
Peter
tried
to
stop
it:
-
No!
No!
No
talk
of
the
house,
Henry
Chinaski!
-
Let
him
read,
Peter!
I
wanted
to
look
at
her
buttocks.
She
paced
up
and
down
the
old
one
the
coffee
table.
Then
began
to
dance.
She
waved
her
arms.
Poetry
was
terrible,
and
the
madness
of
the
body
-
not
at
all.
Lydia
jumped.
-
How
do
you
like
it,
Henry?
-
What?
-
Poetry.I
already
knocked
50,
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
I
was
four
years
old.
Friends,
women
I
have
never
done.
I
looked
at
the
women
every
time
he
passed
by
on
the
streets
or
in
other
places,
but
without
the
desire
to
look
and
with
a
sense
of
futility.
I
masturbate
regularly,
but
the
thought
of
having
a
relationship
with
a
woman
-
even
on
non-sexual
basis
-
was
beyond
my
imagination.
I
had
a
daughter
6
years
old,
illegitimate.
She
lived
with
her
mother,
and
I
was
paying
child
support.
I
was
married
many
years
ago,
when
I
was
35.
That
marriage
lasted
two
and
a
half
years.
My
wife
divorced
me.
I
was
in
love
once.
She
died
of
acute
alcoholism.
She
died
at
48
and
I
was
38.
His
wife
was
12
years
younger
than
me.
I
guess
now
she
was
dead,
too,
though
not
sure.
6
years
after
the
divorce,
she
wrote
me
a
long
letter
to
every
Christmas.
I
never
said
...
I'm
not
sure
when
I
first
saw
Lydia
Vance.
6
years
ago,
I
think
I
just
threw
the
service
at
the
post
office,
where
spent
twelve
years
and
was
trying
to
become
a
writer.
I
was
in
terror
and
were
drinking
more
than
usual.
I
tried
to
write
the
first
novel.
Every
night,
after
work,
I
drank
a
pint
of
whiskey
and
two
half-dozen
beers.
Smoked
a
cheap
cigar,
printed,
drank
and
listened
to
classical
music
on
the
radio
until
dawn.
I
set
out
to
ten
pages
a
night,
but
never
found
out
the
next
day,
how
much
is
actually
written.
Usually
in
the
morning
I
went
up,
threw
up,
then
went
into
the
front
room
and
looked
at
the
couch
-
how
many
pages.
His
ten
I
always
exceeded.
Sometimes
there
lay
17,
18,
23,
25
pages.
Of
course,
the
work
of
each
night
had
to
be
either
cleaned
or
disposed
of.
On
the
first
novel
I've
gone
twenty
one
night.
Owners
of
the
yard,
where
I
lived,
who
lived
on
the
margins
of
themselves,
thought
I
was
crazy.
Every
morning
when
I
woke
up
on
my
porch
was
a
large
brown
paper
bag.
The
contents
vary,
but
usually
lie
inside
tomatoes,
radishes,
oranges,
green
onions,
cans
of
soup,
red
onion.
Every
now
and
then
at
night
I
drank
beer
with
the
hosts,
4-5
hours
in
the
morning.
The
old
man
chops
off,
and
the
old
woman
and
I
usually
kept
in
hand,
and
sometimes
I
kissed
her.
At
the
door,
always
print
in
addition
to
it
for
real.
She
was
badly
wrinkled,
but
what
can
you
do.
She
was
Catholic
and
looked
very
nice
when
worn
pink
hat
and
set
off
on
Sunday
morning
in
church.
I
think
I
met
Lydia
Vance
on
his
first
poetry
reading.
It
was
held
at
the
bookstore
on
Kenmore
Avenue
-
in
the
"bascule
bridge."
Again,
I
was
terrified.
Arrogant,
but
terrified.
When
I
walked
in,
there
were
only
standing
room.
Before
Peter,
filled
to
the
same
bench
and
lived
with
a
black
girl,
was
a
pile
of
cash.
-
That's
the
same
shit
-
he
said
to
me
-
if
I
could
always
cram
them
here
so
I'd
still
have
enough
time
to
India.
I
walked
in
and
they
applauded.
If
we
talk
about
the
poetry
reading,
I
had
to
tear
myself
hymen.
I
read
30
minutes,
then
ask
for
a
break.
I
have
been
sober
and
felt
at
me
out
of
the
dark
staring
eyes.
Came
to
talk
to
a
few
people.
Then,
during

Vance.
I
sat
at
a

drinking

She
laid
both

on

leaned
forward
and
looked

She
had
long
brown
hair
is
a
decent
length,
a
prominent
nose
and
one
eye
is
not
quite
combined
with
the
other.
But
it
comes
from
the
life
force
-
it
could
not
be
ignored.
I
could
feel
the
vibration
ran
between
us.
Some
-
perverts
and
bad,
but
still
they
were.
She
looked
at
me,
I
looked
back
at
her.
Lydia
Vance
was
suede
cowboy
jacket
with
fringe
on
the
collar.
Her

were

I
said
to
her:
-

Lydia
moved.
It

I
never

And

I
watched

went

I
think
I
just
threw
the
service
at
the
post
office,
where
spent
twelve
years
and
was
trying
to
become
a
writer.
I
was
in
terror
and
were
drinking
more
than
usual.
I
tried
to
write
the
first
novel.
Every
night,
after
work,
I
drank
a
pint
of
whiskey
and
two
half-dozen
beers.
Smoked
a
cheap
cigar,
printed,
drank
and
listened
to
classical
music
on
the
radio
until
dawn.
I
set
out
to
ten
pages
a
night,
but
never
found
out
the
next
day,
how
much
is
actually
written.
Usually
in
the
morning
I
went
up,
threw
up,
then
went
into
the
front
room
and
looked
at
the
couch
-
how
many
pages.
His
ten
I
always
exceeded.
Sometimes
there
lay
17,
18,
23,
25
pages.
Of
course,
the
work
of
each
night
had
to
be
either
cleaned
or
disposed
of.
On
the
first
novel
I've
gone
twenty
one
night.
Owners
of
the
yard,
where
I
lived,
who
lived
on
the
margins
of
themselves,
thought
I
was
crazy.
Every
morning
when
I
woke
up
on
my
porch
was
a
large
brown
paper
bag.
The
contents
vary,
but
usually
lie
inside
tomatoes,
radishes,
oranges,
green
onions,
cans
of
soup,
red
onion.
Every
now
and
then
at
night
I
drank
beer
with
the
hosts,
4-5
hours
in
the
morning.
The
old
man
chops
off,
and
the
old
woman
and
I
usually
kept
in
hand,
and
sometimes
I
kissed
her.
At
the
door,
always
print
in
addition
to
it
for
real.
She
was
badly
wrinkled,
but
what
can
you
do.
She
was
Catholic
and
looked
very
nice
when
worn
pink
hat
and
set
off
on
Sunday
morning
in
church.
I
think
I
met
Lydia
Vance
on
his
first
poetry
reading.
It
was
held
at
the
bookstore
on
Kenmore
Avenue
-
in
the
"bascule
bridge."
Again,
I
was
terrified.
Arrogant,
but
terrified.
When
I
walked
in,
there
were
only
standing
room.
Before
Peter,
filled
to
the
same
bench
and
lived
with
a
black
girl,
was
a
pile
of
cash.
-
That's
the
same
shit
-
he
said
to
me
-
if
I
could
always
cram
them
here
so
I'd
still
have
enough
time
to
India.
I
walked
in
and
they
applauded.
If
we
talk
about
the
poetry
reading,
I
had
to
tear
myself
hymen.
I
read
30
minutes,
then
ask
for
a
break.
I
have
been
sober
and
felt
at
me
out
of
the
dark
staring
eyes.
Came
to
talk
to
a
few
people.
Then,
during
a
lull,
came
Lydia
Vance.
I
sat
at
a
table
drinking
beer.
She
laid
both
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table,
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
me.
She
had
long
brown
hair
is
a
decent
length,
a
prominent
nose
and
one
eye
is
not
quite
combined
with
the
other.
But
it
comes
from
the
life
force
-
it
could
not
be
ignored.
I
could
feel
the
vibration
ran
between
us.
Some
-
perverts
and
bad,
but
still
they
were.
She
looked
at
me,
I
looked
back
at
her.
Lydia
Vance
was
suede
cowboy
jacket
with
fringe
on
the
collar.
Her
breasts
were
nothing.
I
said
to
her:
-
I
would
like
to
tear
off
your
jacket
with
fringe
-
with
this
we
could
start.
Lydia
moved.
It
did
not
work.
I
never
know
what
to
say
to
the
ladies.
And
feed
her
well.
I
watched
this
beautiful
stern
when
Lydia
departed.
Back
jeans
hugged
her
and
I
watched
her
as
she
sails
away.
I
finished
the
second
half
of
the
readings
and
forgot
about
Lydia
as
forget
about
all
the
women
who
were
overtaken
on
the
sidewalks.
Took
my
money,
signed
a
few
napkins,
a
few
scraps
of
paper,
then
went
back
home.
I
am
still
working
every
night
on
the
first
novel.
Until
6.18
pm
to
write
I
never
sat
down.
It
was
then
that
I
observed
at
the
entrance
of
his
wing
of
the
terminal
at
the
post
office.
And
they
showed
up
at
6:
Peter
and
Lydia
Vance.
I
opened
the
door.
Peter
said:
-
Look,
Henry,
look
what
I
brought
you!
Lydia
jumped
up
on
the
coffee
table.
Jeans
sitting
on
it,
instead.
She
shook
her
long
brown
hair
from
side
to
side.
It
was
insane,
it
was
marvelous.
I
first
considered
the
possibility
of
having
to
actually
make
love
to
her.
She
began
to
read
poetry.
Own.
It
was
very
bad.
Peter
tried
to
stop
it:
-
No!
No!
No
talk
of
the
house,
Henry
Chinaski!
-
Let
him
read,
Peter!
I
wanted
to
look
at
her
buttocks.
She
paced
up
and
down
the
old
one
the
coffee
table.
Then
began
to
dance.
She
waved
her
arms.
Poetry
was
terrible,
and
the
madness
of
the
body
-
not
at
all.
Lydia
jumped.
-
How
do
you
like
it,
Henry?
-
What?
-
Poetry.I
already
knocked
50,
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
I
was
four
years
old.
Friends,
women
I
have
never
done.
I
looked
at
the
women
every
time
he
passed
by
on
the
streets
or
in
other
places,
but
without
the
desire
to
look
and
with
a
sense
of
futility.
I
masturbate
regularly,
but
the
thought
of
having
a
relationship
with
a
woman
-
even
on
non-sexual
basis
-
was
beyond
my
imagination.
I
had
a
daughter
6
years
old,
illegitimate.
She
lived
with
her
mother,
and
I
was
paying
child
support.
I
was
married
many
years
ago,
when
I
was
35.
That
marriage
lasted
two
and
a
half
years.
My
wife
divorced
me.
I
was
in
love
once.
She
died
of
acute
alcoholism.
She
died
at
48
and
I
was
38.
His
wife
was
12
years
younger
than
me.
I
guess
now
she
was
dead,
too,
though
not
sure.
6
years
after
the
divorce,
she
wrote
me
a
long
letter
to
every
Christmas.
I
never
said
...
I'm
not
sure
when
I
first
saw
Lydia
Vance.
6

I
think
I
just

forgot
about
Lydia
as
forget
about
all
the
women
who
were
overtaken
on
the
sidewalks.
Took
my
money,
signed
a
few
napkins,
a
few
scraps
of
paper,
then
went
back
home.
I
am
still
working
every
night
on
the
first
novel.
Until
6.18
pm
to
write
I
never
sat
down.
It
was
then
that
I
observed
at
the
entrance
of
his
wing
of
the
terminal
at
the
post
office.
And
they
showed
up
at
6:
Peter
and
Lydia
Vance.
I
opened
the
door.
Peter
said:
-
Look,
Henry,
look
what
I
brought
you!
Lydia
jumped
up
on
the
coffee
table.
Jeans
sitting
on
it,
instead.
She
shook
her
long
brown
hair
from
side
to
side.
It
was
insane,
it
was
marvelous.
I
first
considered
the
possibility
of
having
to
actually
make
love
to
her.
She
began
to
read
poetry.
Own.
It
was
very
bad.
Peter
tried
to
stop
it:
-
No!
No!
No
talk
of
the
house,
Henry
Chinaski!
-
Let
him
read,
Peter!
I
wanted
to
look
at
her
buttocks.
She
paced
up
and
down
the
old
one
the
coffee
table.
Then
began
to
dance.
She
waved
her
arms.
Poetry
was
terrible,
and
the
madness
of
the
body
-
not
at
all.
Lydia
jumped.
-
How
do
you
like
it,
Henry?
-
What?
-
Poetry.I
already
knocked
50,
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
I
was
four
years
old.
Friends,
women
I
have
never
done.
I
looked
at
the
women
every
time
he
passed
by
on
the
streets
or
in
other
places,
but
without
the
desire
to
look
and
with
a
sense
of
futility.
I
masturbate
regularly,
but
the
thought
of
having
a
relationship
with
a
woman
-
even
on
non-sexual
basis
-
was
beyond
my
imagination.
I
had
a
daughter
6
years
old,
illegitimate.
She
lived
with
her
mother,
and
I
was
paying
child
support.
I
was
married
many
years
ago,
when
I
was
35.
That
marriage
lasted
two
and
a
half
years.
My
wife
divorced
me.
I
was
in
love
once.
She
died
of
acute
alcoholism.
She
died
at
48
and
I
was
38.
His
wife
was
12
years
younger
than
me.
I
guess
now
she
was
dead,
too,
though
not
sure.
6
years
after
the
divorce,
she
wrote
me
a
long
letter
to
every
Christmas.
I
never
said
...
I'm
not
sure
when
I
first
saw
Lydia
Vance.
6
years
ago,
I
think
I
just
threw
the
service
at
the
post
office,
where
spent
twelve
years
and
was
trying
to
become
a
writer.
I
was
in
terror
and
were
drinking
more
than
usual.
I
tried
to
write
the
first
novel.
Every
night,
after
work,
I
drank
a
pint
of
whiskey
and
two
half-dozen
beers.
Smoked
a
cheap
cigar,
printed,
drank
and
listened
to
classical
music
on
the
radio
until
dawn.
I
set
out
to
ten
pages
a
night,
but
never
found
out
the
next
day,
how
much
is
actually
written.
Usually
in
the
morning
I
went
up,
threw
up,
then
went
into
the
front
room
and
looked
at
the
couch
-
how
many
pages.
His
ten
I
always
exceeded.
Sometimes
there
lay
17,
18,
23,
25
pages.
Of
course,
the
work
of
each
night
had
to
be
either
cleaned
or
disposed
of.
On
the
first
novel
I've
gone
twenty
one
night.
Owners
of
the
yard,
where
I
lived,
who
lived
on
the
margins
of
themselves,
thought
I
was
crazy.
Every
morning
when
I
woke
up
on
my
porch
was
a
large
brown
paper
bag.
The
contents
vary,
but
usually
lie
inside
tomatoes,
radishes,
oranges,
green
onions,
cans
of
soup,
red
onion.
Every
now
and
then
at
night
I
drank
beer
with
the
hosts,
4-5
hours
in
the
morning.
The
old
man
chops
off,
and
the
old
woman
and
I
usually
kept
in
hand,
and
sometimes
I
kissed
her.
At
the
door,
always
print
in
addition
to
it
for
real.
She
was
badly
wrinkled,
but
what
can
you
do.
She
was
Catholic
and
looked
very
nice
when
worn
pink
hat
and
set
off
on
Sunday
morning
in
church.
I
think
I
met
Lydia
Vance
on
his
first
poetry
reading.
It
was
held
at
the
bookstore
on
Kenmore
Avenue
-
in
the
"bascule
bridge."
Again,
I
was
terrified.
Arrogant,
but
terrified.
When
I
walked
in,
there
were
only
standing
room.
Before
Peter,
filled
to
the
same
bench
and
lived
with
a
black
girl,
was
a
pile
of
cash.
-
That's
the
same
shit
-
he
said
to
me
-
if
I
could
always
cram
them
here
so
I'd
still
have
enough
time
to
India.
I
walked
in
and
they
applauded.
If
we
talk
about
the
poetry
reading,
I
had
to
tear
myself
hymen.
I
read
30
minutes,
then
ask
for
a
break.
I
have
been
sober
and
felt
at
me
out
of
the
dark
staring
eyes.
Came
to
talk
to
a
few
people.
Then,
during
a
lull,
came
Lydia
Vance.
I
sat
at
a
table
drinking
beer.
She
laid
both
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table,
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
me.
She
had
long
brown
hair
is
a
decent
length,
a
prominent
nose
and
one
eye
is
not
quite
combined
with
the
other.
But
it
comes
from
the
life
force
-
it
could
not
be
ignored.
I
could
feel
the
vibration
ran
between
us.
Some
-
perverts
and
bad,
but
still
they
were.
She
looked
at
me,
I
looked
back
at
her.
Lydia
Vance
was
suede
cowboy
jacket
with
fringe
on
the
collar.
Her
breasts
were
nothing.
I
said
to
her:
-
I
would
like
to
tear
off
your
jacket
with
fringe
-
with
this
we
could
start.
Lydia
moved.
It
did
not
work.
I
never
know
what
to
say
to
the
ladies.
And
feed
her
well.
I
watched
this
beautiful
stern
when
Lydia
departed.
Back
jeans
hugged
her
and
I
watched
her
as
she
sails
away.
I
finished
the
second
half
of
the
readings
and
forgot
about
Lydia
as
forget
about
all
the
women
who
were
overtaken
on
the
sidewalks.
Took
my
money,
signed
a
few
napkins,
a
few
scraps
of
paper,
then
went
back
home.
I
am
still
working
every

on
the

Every

I
drank

The

At

She
was

what
can
you
do.
She
was
Catholic
and
looked
very
nice
when
worn
pink
hat
and
set

on
Sunday

in

I
think
I
met
Lydia
Vance
on
his
first
poetry
reading.
It
was
held
at
the
bookstore
on
Kenmore
Avenue
-
in
the
"bascule
bridge."
Again,
I
was
terrified.
Arrogant,
but
terrified.
When
I
walked
in,
there
were
only
standing
room.
Before
Peter,
filled
to
the
same
bench
and
lived
with
a
black
girl,
was
a
pile
of
cash.
-
That's
the
same
shit
-
he
said
to
me
-
if
I
could
always
cram
them
here
so
I'd
still
have
enough
time
to
India.
I
walked
in
and
they
applauded.
If
we
talk
about
the
poetry
reading,
I
had
to
tear
myself
hymen.
I
read
30
minutes,
then
ask
for
a
break.
I
have
been
sober
and
felt
at
me
out
of
the
dark
staring
eyes.
Came
to
talk
to
a
few
people.
Then,
during
a
lull,
came
Lydia
Vance.
I
sat
at
a
table
drinking
beer.
She
laid
both
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table,
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
me.
She
had
long
brown
hair
is
a
decent
length,
a
prominent
nose
and
one
eye
is
not
quite
combined
with
the
other.
But
it
comes
from
the
life
force
-
it
could
not
be
ignored.
I
could
feel
the
vibration
ran
between
us.
Some
-
perverts
and
bad,
but
still
they
were.
She
looked
at
me,
I
looked
back
at
her.
Lydia
Vance
was
suede
cowboy
jacket
with
fringe
on
the
collar.
Her
breasts
were
nothing.
I
said
to
her:
-
I
would
like
to
tear
off
your
jacket
with
fringe
-
with
this
we
could
start.
Lydia
moved.
It
did
not
work.
I
never
know
what
to
say
to
the
ladies.
And
feed
her
well.
I
watched
this
beautiful
stern
when
Lydia
departed.
Back
jeans
hugged
her
and
I
watched
her
as
she
sails
away.
I
finished
the
second
half
of
the
readings
and
forgot
about
Lydia
as
forget
about
all
the
women
who
were
overtaken
on
the
sidewalks.
Took
my
money,
signed
a
few
napkins,
a
few
scraps
of
paper,
then
went
back
home.
I
am
still
working
every
night
on
the
first
novel.
Until
6.18
pm
to
write
I
never
sat
down.
It
was
then
that
I
observed
at
the
entrance
of
his
wing
of
the
terminal
at
the
post
office.
And
they
showed
up
at
6:
Peter
and
Lydia
Vance.
I
opened
the
door.
Peter
said:
-
Look,
Henry,
look
what
I
brought
you!
Lydia
jumped
up
on
the
coffee
table.
Jeans
sitting
on
it,
instead.
She
shook
her
long
brown
hair
from
side
to
side.
It
was
insane,
it
was
marvelous.
I
first
considered
the
possibility
of
having
to
actually
make
love
to
her.
She
began
to
read
poetry.
Own.
It
was
very
bad.
Peter
tried
to
stop
it:
-
No!
No!
No
talk
of
the
house,
Henry
Chinaski!
-
Let
him
read,
Peter!
I
wanted
to
look
at
her
buttocks.
She
paced
up
and
down
the
old
one
the
coffee
table.
Then
began
to
dance.
She
waved
her
arms.
Poetry
was
terrible,
and
the
madness
of
the
body
-
not
at
all.
Lydia
jumped.
-
How
do
you
like
it,
Henry?
-
What?
-
Poetry.I
already
knocked
50,
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
I
was
four
years
old.
Friends,
women
I
have
never
done.
I
looked
at
the
women
every
time
he
passed
by
on
the
streets
or
in
other
places,
but
without
the
desire
to
look
and
with
a
sense
of
futility.
I
masturbate
regularly,
but
the
thought
of
having
a
relationship
with
a
woman
-
even
on
non-sexual
basis
-
was
beyond
my
imagination.
I
had
a
daughter
6
years
old,
illegitimate.
She
lived
with
her
mother,
and
I
was
paying
child
support.
I
was
married
many
years
ago,
when
I
was
35.
That
marriage
lasted
two
and
a
half
years.
My
wife
divorced
me.
I
was
in
love
once.
She
died
of
acute
alcoholism.
She
died
at
48
and
I
was
38.
His
wife
was
12
years
younger
than
me.
I
guess
now
she
was
dead,
too,
though
not
sure.
6
years
after
the
divorce,
she
wrote
me
a
long
letter
to
every
Christmas.
I
never
said
...
I'm
not
sure
when
I
first
saw
Lydia
Vance.
6
years
ago,
I
think
I
just
threw
the
service
at
the
post
office,
where
spent
twelve
years
and
was
trying
to
become
a
writer.
I
was
in
terror
and
were
drinking
more
than
usual.
I
tried
to
write
the
first
novel.
Every
night,
after
work,
I
drank
a
pint
of
whiskey
and
two
half-dozen
beers.
Smoked
a
cheap
cigar,
printed,
drank
and
listened
to
classical
music
on
the
radio
until
dawn.
I
set
out
to
ten
pages
a
night,
but
never
found
out
the
next
day,
how
much
is
actually
written.
Usually
in
the
morning
I
went
up,
threw
up,
then
went
into
the
front
room
and
looked
at
the
couch
-
how
many
pages.
His
ten
I
always
exceeded.
Sometimes
there
lay
17,
18,
23,
25
pages.
Of
course,
the
work
of
each
night
had
to
be
either
cleaned
or
disposed
of.
On
the
first
novel
I've
gone
twenty
one
night.
Owners
of
the
yard,
where
I
lived,
who
lived
on
the
margins
of
themselves,
thought
I
was
crazy.
Every
morning
when
I
woke
up
on
my
porch
was
a
large
brown
paper
bag.
The
contents
vary,
but
usually
lie
inside
tomatoes,
radishes,
oranges,
green
onions,
cans
of
soup,
red
onion.
Every

what

Poetry
was

and

Lydia
jumped.
-
How
do
you
like
it,
Henry?
-
What?

Poetry.I
already
knocked
50,
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
I
was
four
years
old.
Friends,
women
I
have
never
done.
I
looked
at
the
women
every
time
he
passed
by
on
the
streets
or
in
other
places,
but
without
the
desire
to
look
and
with
a
sense
of

I
masturbate

but
the
thought
of
having
a
relationship
with
a
woman
-
even
on
non-sexual
basis
-
was
beyond
my

I
had
a
daughter
6
years
old,
illegitimate.
She
lived
with
her
mother,
and
I
was
paying
child
support.
I
was
married
many
years
ago,
when
I
was
35.
That
marriage
lasted
two
and
a
half
years.
My
wife
divorced
me.
I
was
in
love
once.
She
died
of
acute
alcoholism.
She
died
at
48
and
I
was
38.
His
wife
was
12
years
younger
than
me.
I
guess
now
she
was
dead,
too,
though
not
sure.
6
years
after
the
divorce,
she
wrote
me
a
long
letter
to
every
Christmas.
I
never
said
...
I'm
not
sure
when
I
first
saw
Lydia
Vance.
6
years
ago,
I
think
I
just
threw
the
service
at
the
post
office,
where
spent
twelve
years
and
was
trying
to
become
a
writer.
I
was
in
terror
and
were
drinking
more
than
usual.
I
tried
to
write
the
first
novel.
Every
night,
after
work,
I
drank
a
pint
of
whiskey
and
two
half-dozen
beers.
Smoked
a
cheap
cigar,
printed,
drank
and
listened
to
classical
music
on
the
radio
until
dawn.
I
set
out
to
ten
pages
a
night,
but
never
found
out
the
next
day,
how
much
is
actually
written.
Usually
in
the
morning
I
went
up,
threw
up,
then
went
into
the
front
room
and
looked
at
the
couch
-
how
many
pages.
His
ten
I
always
exceeded.
Sometimes
there
lay
17,
18,
23,
25
pages.
Of
course,
the
work
of
each
night
had
to
be
either
cleaned
or
disposed
of.
On
the
first
novel
I've
gone
twenty
one
night.
Owners
of
the
yard,
where
I
lived,
who
lived
on
the
margins
of
themselves,
thought
I
was
crazy.
Every
morning
when
I
woke
up
on
my
porch
was
a
large
brown
paper
bag.
The
contents
vary,
but
usually
lie
inside
tomatoes,
radishes,
oranges,
green
onions,
cans
of
soup,
red
onion.
Every
now
and
then
at
night
I
drank
beer
with
the
hosts,
4-5
hours
in
the
morning.
The
old
man
chops
off,
and
the
old
woman
and
I
usually
kept
in
hand,
and
sometimes
I
kissed
her.
At
the
door,
always
print
in
addition
to
it
for

She
was
badly
wrinkled,
but
what
can
you
do.
She
was
Catholic
and
looked
very
nice
when
worn
pink
hat
and
set
off
on
Sunday
morning
in
church.
I
think
I
met
Lydia
Vance
on
his
first
poetry
reading.
It
was
held
at
the
bookstore
on
Kenmore
Avenue
-
in
the
"bascule
bridge."
Again,
I
was
terrified.
Arrogant,
but
terrified.
When
I
walked
in,
there
were
only
standing
room.
Before
Peter,
filled
to
the
same
bench
and
lived
with
a
black
girl,
was
a
pile
of
cash.
-
That's
the
same
shit
-
he
said
to
me
-
if
I
could
always
cram
them
here
so
I'd
still
have
enough
time
to
India.
I
walked
in
and
they
applauded.
If
we
talk
about
the
poetry
reading,
I
had
to
tear
myself
hymen.
I
read
30
minutes,
then
ask
for
a
break.
I
have
been
sober
and
felt
at
me
out
of
the
dark
staring
eyes.
Came
to
talk
to
a
few
people.
Then,
during
a
lull,
came
Lydia
Vance.
I
sat
at
a
table
drinking
beer.
She
laid
both
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table,
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
me.
She
had
long
brown
hair
is
a
decent
length,
a
prominent
nose
and
one
eye
is
not
quite
combined
with
the
other.
But
it
comes
from
the
life
force
-
it
could
not
be
ignored.
I
could
feel
the
vibration
ran
between
us.
Some
-
perverts
and
bad,
but
still
they
were.
She
looked
at
me,
I
looked
back
at
her.
Lydia
Vance
was
suede
cowboy
jacket
with
fringe
on
the
collar.
Her
breasts
were
nothing.
I
said
to
her:
-
I
would
like
to
tear
off
your
jacket
with
fringe
-
with
this
we
could
start.
Lydia
moved.
It
did
not
work.
I
never
know
what
to
say
to
the
ladies.
And
feed
her
well.
I
watched
this
beautiful
stern
when
Lydia
departed.
Back
jeans
hugged
her
and
I
watched
her
as
she
sails
away.
I
finished
the
second
half
of
the
readings
and
forgot
about
Lydia
as
forget
about
all
the
women
who
were
overtaken
on
the
sidewalks.
Took
my
money,
signed
a
few
napkins,
a
few
scraps
of
paper,
then
went
back
home.
I
am
still
working
every
night
on
the
first
novel.
Until
6.18
pm
to
write
I
never
sat
down.
It
was
then
that
I
observed
at
the
entrance
of
his
wing
of
the
terminal
at
the
post
office.
And
they
showed
up
at
6:
Peter
and
Lydia
Vance.
I
opened
the
door.
Peter
said:
-
Look,
Henry,
look
what
I
brought
you!
Lydia
jumped
up
on
the
coffee
table.
Jeans
sitting
on
it,
instead.
She
shook
her
long
brown
hair
from
side
to
side.
It
was
insane,
it
was
marvelous.
I
first
considered
the
possibility
of
having
to
actually
make
love
to
her.
She
began
to
read
poetry.
Own.
It
was
very
bad.
Peter
tried
to
stop
it:
-
No!
No!
No
talk
of
the
house,
Henry
Chinaski!
-
Let
him
read,
Peter!
I
wanted
to
look
at
her
buttocks.
She
paced
up
and
down
the
old
one
the
coffee
table.
Then
began
to
dance.
She
waved
her
arms.
Poetry
was
terrible,
and
the
madness
of
the
body
-
not
at
all.
Lydia
jumped.
-
How
do
you
like
it,
Henry?
-

and
they
applauded.
If
we
talk
about
the
poetry
reading,
I
had
to
tear
myself
hymen.
I
read
30
minutes,
then
ask
for
a
break.
I
have
been
sober
and
felt
at
me
out
of
the
dark
staring
eyes.
Came
to
talk
to
a
few
people.
Then,
during
a
lull,
came
Lydia
Vance.
I
sat
at
a
table
drinking
beer.
She
laid
both
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
table,
leaned
forward
and
looked
at
me.
She
had
long
brown
hair
is
a
decent
length,
a
prominent
nose
and
one
eye
is
not
quite
combined
with
the
other.
But
it
comes
from
the
life
force
-
it
could
not
be
ignored.
I
could
feel
the
vibration
ran
between
us.
Some
-
perverts
and
bad,
but
still
they
were.
She
looked
at
me,
I
looked
back
at
her.
Lydia
Vance
was
suede
cowboy
jacket
with
fringe
on
the
collar.
Her
breasts
were
nothing.
I
said
to
her:
-
I
would
like
to
tear
off
your
jacket
with
fringe
-
with
this
we
could
start.
Lydia
moved.
It
did
not
work.
I
never
know
what
to
say
to
the
ladies.
And
feed
her
well.
I
watched
this
beautiful
stern
when
Lydia
departed.
Back
jeans
hugged
her
and
I
watched
her
as
she
sails
away.
I
finished
the
second
half
of
the
readings
and
forgot
about
Lydia
as
forget
about
all
the
women
who
were
overtaken
on
the
sidewalks.
Took
my
money,
signed
a
few
napkins,
a
few
scraps
of
paper,
then
went
back
home.
I
am
still
working
every
night
on
the
first
novel.
Until
6.18
pm
to
write
I
never
sat
down.
It
was
then
that
I
observed
at
the
entrance
of
his
wing
of
the
terminal
at
the
post
office.
And
they
showed
up
at
6:
Peter
and
Lydia
Vance.
I
opened
the
door.
Peter
said:
-
Look,
Henry,
look
what
I
brought
you!
Lydia
jumped
up
on
the
coffee
table.
Jeans
sitting
on
it,
instead.
She
shook
her
long
brown
hair
from
side
to
side.
It
was
insane,
it
was
marvelous.
I
first
considered
the
possibility
of
having
to
actually
make
love
to
her.
She
began
to
read
poetry.
Own.
It
was
very
bad.
Peter
tried
to
stop
it:
-
No!
No!
No
talk
of
the
house,
Henry
Chinaski!
-
Let
him
read,
Peter!
I
wanted
to
look
at
her
buttocks.
She
paced
up
and
down
the
old
one
the
coffee
table.
Then
began
to
dance.
She
waved
her
arms.
Poetry
was
terrible,
and
the
madness
of
the
body
-
not
at
all.
Lydia
jumped.
-
How
do
you
like
it,
Henry?
-
What?
-
Poetry.I
already
knocked
50,
and
the
woman
in
the
bed
I
was
four
years
old.
Friends,
women
I
have
never
done.
I
looked
at
the
women
every
time
he
passed
by
on
the
streets
or
in
other
places,
but
without
the
desire
to
look
and
with
a
sense
of
futility.
I
masturbate
regularly,
but
the
thought
of
having
a
relationship
with
a
woman
-
even
on
non-sexual
basis
-
was
beyond
my
imagination.
I
had
a
daughter
6
years
old,
illegitimate.
She
lived
with
her
mother,
and
I
was
paying
child
support.
I
was
married
many
years
ago,
when
I
was
35.
That
marriage
lasted
two
and
a
half
years.
My
wife
divorced
me.
I
was
in
love
once.
She
died
of
acute
alcoholism.
She
died
at
48
and
I
was
38.
His
wife
was
12
years
younger
than
me.
I
guess
now
she
was
dead,
too,
though
not
sure.
6
years
after
the
divorce,
she
wrote
me
a
long
letter
to
every
Christmas.
I
never
said
...
I'm
not
sure
when
I
first
saw
Lydia
Vance.
6
years
ago,
I
think
I
just
threw
the
service
at
the
post
office,
where
spent
twelve
years
and
was
trying
to
become
a
writer.
I
was
in
terror
and
were
drinking
more
than
usual.
I
tried
to
write
the
first
novel.
Every
night,
after
work,
I
drank
a
pint
of
whiskey
and
two
half-dozen
beers.
Smoked
a
cheap
cigar,
printed,
drank
and
listened
to
classical
music
on
the
radio
until
dawn.
I
set
out
to
ten
pages
a
night,
but
never
found
out
the
next
day,
how
much
is
actually
written.
Usually
in
the
morning
I
went
up,
threw
up,
then
went
into
the
front
room
and
looked
at
the
couch
-
how
many
pages.
His
ten
I
always
exceeded.
Sometimes
there
lay
17,
18,
23,
25
pages.
Of
course,
the
work
of
each
night
had
to
be
either
cleaned
or
disposed
of.
On
the
first
novel
I've
gone
twenty
one
night.
Owners
of
the
yard,
where
I
lived,
who
lived
on
the
margins
of
themselves,
thought
I
was
crazy.
Every
morning
when
I
woke
up
on
my
porch
was
a
large
brown
paper
bag.
The
contents
vary,
but
usually
lie
inside
tomatoes,
radishes,
oranges,
green
onions,
cans
of
soup,
red
onion.
Every
now
and
then
at
night
I
drank
beer
with
the
hosts,
4-5
hours
in
the
morning.
The
old
man
chops
off,
and
the
old
woman
and
I
usually
kept
in
hand,
and
sometimes
I
kissed
her.
At
the
door,
always
print
in
addition
to
it
for
real.
She
was
badly
wrinkled,
but
what
can
you
do.
She
was
Catholic
and
looked
very
nice
when
worn
pink
hat
and
set
off
on
Sunday
morning
in
church.
I
think
I
met
Lydia
Vance
on
his
first
poetry
reading.
It
was
held
at
the
bookstore
on
Kenmore
Avenue
-
in
the
"bascule
bridge."
Again,
I
was
terrified.
Arrogant,
but
terrified.
When
I
walked
in,
there
were
only
standing
room.
Before
Peter,
filled
to
the
same
bench
and
lived
with
a
black
girl,
was
a
pile
of
cash.
-
That's
the
same
shit
-
he
said
to
me
-
if
I
could
always
cram
them
here
so
I'd
still
have
enough
time
to
India.
I
walked
in
and
they
applauded.
If
we
talk
about
the
poetry

I
had
to
tear

I

She
had

a

a

and
one
eye
is
not
quite
combined
with
the
other.
But
it
comes
from
the
life
force
-
it
could
not
be
ignored.
I
could
feel
the
vibration
ran
between
us.
Some
-
perverts
and
bad,
but
still
they
were.
She
looked
at
me,
I
looked
back
at
her.
Lydia
Vance
was
suede

with

Her

I
said
to
her:

Lydia
